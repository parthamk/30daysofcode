**1. Difference between Compiler and Interpreter:**

- **Definition:**
  - **Compiler:** A compiler is a program that translates the entire source code of a program into machine code or another lower-level code in one go, creating an executable file.
  - **Interpreter:** An interpreter is a program that reads and executes code line-by-line, translating and executing it simultaneously.

- **Translation Process:**
  - **Compiler:** Translates the entire program before execution and generates an intermediate code or machine code.
  - **Interpreter:** Translates and executes code line by line without generating an intermediate code.

- **Execution Speed:**
  - **Compiler:** Generally produces faster execution as the code is pre-translated into machine code.
  - **Interpreter:** May be slower since it translates and executes code in real-time.

- **Debugging:**
  - **Compiler:** May have more challenging debugging as errors are reported after the entire code is compiled.
  - **Interpreter:** Easier debugging as errors are reported immediately after each line is executed.

- **Examples:**
  - **Compiler Languages:** C, C++, Java (before Just-In-Time compilation).
  - **Interpreter Languages:** Python, JavaScript.

**2. JavaScript (JS) as a Compiler or Intermediate Language:**

- JavaScript is primarily an interpreted language.
- However, modern JavaScript engines often use a combination of interpretation and compilation techniques to optimize code execution.
- JavaScript engines like V8 (used in Chrome) employ Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, where parts of the code are compiled into machine code at runtime for improved performance.
- So, while JavaScript is mainly interpreted, it incorporates compilation for optimization.

**3. Is JavaScript (JS) an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Language:**

- Yes, JavaScript is considered an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language.
- It supports key OOP principles like objects, classes (with ES6 and later), encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- JavaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance model, where objects inherit properties and behaviors directly from other objects, making it unique compared to class-based OOP languages like Java or C++.
- We can create and manipulate objects in JavaScript, making it suitable for building complex, object-oriented applications.
