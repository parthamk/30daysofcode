**1. Difference between High-Level and Low-Level Language:**

**High-Level Language:**

1. **Abstraction:**
   - **High-Level Language:** Provides a high level of abstraction from the machine details.
   - **Example:** Python, Java, C++, etc.

2. **Readability and Writability:**
   - **High-Level Language:** Code is more readable and writable, making it easier for programmers to understand and maintain.
   - **Example:** Python code is often more readable than machine code.

3. **Portability:**
   - **High-Level Language:** Programs written in high-level languages are usually more portable across different platforms.
   - **Example:** A Java program can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

4. **Productivity:**
   - **High-Level Language:** Generally offers higher productivity as it allows developers to focus on solving problems rather than managing machine-specific details.
   - **Example:** Rapid development in languages like Python.

**Low-Level Language:**

1. **Abstraction:**
   - **Low-Level Language:** Provides a low level of abstraction, and the code is more closely related to hardware architecture.
   - **Example:** Assembly language, machine code.

2. **Readability and Writability:**
   - **Low-Level Language:** Code is less readable and writable, often involving detailed instructions specific to the machine architecture.
   - **Example:** Writing in machine code requires dealing with binary instructions.

3. **Portability:**
   - **Low-Level Language:** Programs written in low-level languages are less portable as they are tied closely to the hardware architecture.
   - **Example:** Assembly language programs are often specific to a particular CPU architecture.

4. **Productivity:**
   - **Low-Level Language:** Generally, lower productivity due to the need to manage hardware details explicitly.
   - **Example:** Writing in machine code can be time-consuming and error-prone.

**2. JavaScript (JS) and its Language Level:**

JavaScript is considered a high-level programming language. Here's why:

1. **Abstraction:**
   - JavaScript abstracts away many low-level details, providing a more straightforward and abstracted way of programming.

2. **Readability and Writability:**
   - JavaScript code is designed to be readable and writable, making it accessible for developers to create and maintain code efficiently.

3. **Portability:**
   - JavaScript is highly portable, as it can run on various platforms and browsers without modification.

4. **Productivity:**
   - JavaScript enables high productivity by allowing developers to focus on solving problems rather than dealing with low-level details.
